There are basically two ways to couple C++ code to matlab
1. Build a mex file and do a direct library call
* fast, no dirty tricks
* but: all the libraries that are used must have the same version as matlab
** this gets really problematic for projects that use many libs
2. build a stand alone app and simply execute that application
* data transfer has to be done by writing files
** slow
* a new process is started
** no library dependencies

Here, I chose 2, because the library problems of 1 are just too incomprehensible.
