/** @brief Abstract class of a reaction in a metabolic network.
 *
 * The transformation speed reactants into products of a reaction is described by the flux through the reaction.
 * The flux can be bounded by an upper and lower bound. When we optimize on fluxes, each reaction has an objective coefficient (which may be 0).
 * For debugging purposes each reaction also has a name. This name must not be unique, though (although uniqueness will help debugging a lot!).
 *
 * Each Reaction belongs to a Model. Hence, reactions should be created using the factory method Model::createReaction().
 * Usually, however, the model instantiation already creates the reaction. So there is no need for the user to create reactions manually.
 *
 * This class abstractely represents reactions with these properties. Implementations may use direct implementations or SBML-models as a data-backend.
