 * Creates a naive implementation of thermodynamic constraints where all strict inequalities are relaxed to weak inequalities.

 * The relaxed constraint simply states that flux and potential difference must have different signs, or one of them has to be zero.
 *
 * Note, that this formulation is significantly weaker than even the weak formulation of thermodynamic constraints.
 *
 * This constraint requires ReactionDirections as addon.
 * It basically simply initializes the constraints of the reaction direction vars of all internal reactions
