/**
 * This class distinguishes from LPPotentials that it is designed to find small infeasible sets.
 *
 * Although, the LP formulation is derived from the dual of LPPotentials, it has some modifications.
 * These modifications would have created a mess, if implemented as an additional feature in LPPotentials.
 *
 * The problem that we will solve looks as follows:
 *
 * min \Eins \alpha_(N unfixed) - \Eins \alpha_(P unfixed)
 * 		u \beta^+ - \ell \beta^- + \gamma \leq 0
 * 		S \alpha + beta^+ - \beta^- = 0
 * 		\gamma + \Eins \alpha_N - \Eins \alpha_P = 1 \\
 * 		\alpha_N \geq 0
 * 		\alpha_P \leq 0
 * 		\alpha_(not N nor P) = 0
 * 		\beta^+, \beta^-, \gamma \geq 0
