/** This class represents metabolic network models.
 *
 * A metabolic network consists of a list of reactions and metabolites.
 * Depending on the properties of the reactions, some reactions are flux forcing, respectively contain non-zero objective coefficient.
 *
 * A Model stores a list of all reactions. A Reaction must not exist without a Model.
 * For performance reasons, Model also maintains lists of flux forcing reactions, i.e. reactions that have positive lower bound or negative upper bound.
 * Also, a list of reactions with objective coefficient unequal to zero is maintained for the same reason.
 * Hence, it is important to call updateReaction(ReactionPtr) if a reaction was modified (usually the reaction implementation does this automatically).
