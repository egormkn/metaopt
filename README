fast-tfva 2.0
=============
fast-tfva is a tool for fast thermodynamic constrained flux-variability analysis. It is written as a C++ plugin script for Matlab.

A Remark on Version 2.0
=======================
fast-tfva 2.0 is a complete rewrite. It is
* does not necessarily depend on libSBML
* easier to install
* easier to extend
  * constraints on metabolite concentrations are supported
  * additional constraints can easily be added when using the C++ library

Installation of fast-tfva
=========================
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
This instruction is designed for Linux and may also work for other UNIX-type systems. For Windows you will probably have to adjust some configura
tions. (If you have an install instruction for Windows, please send them to me!)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fast-tfva 2.0 uses:
* SCIP Optimization Suite - http://scip.zib.de

Optionally you can link in
* libSBML - http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML
* Matlab

Without SCIP, you won't be able to run fast-tfva. SCIP is open-source. See its webpage for lincensing-details.

On university computers it is usually the case that the user does not have root access. Hence, the installation procedure is designed to work also with non-root access.

After you have installed all the third-party dependencies (see third_party/README for instructions), you simply have to call make to build the fast tfva.

If you have no matlab dependencies installed, call
make MATLAB=off

If you have no sbml dependencies installed, call
make SBML=off

Those two options can also be intercombined. Per default, usage of Matlab and SBML is activated.


Testing of fast-tfva
====================

If you compiled fast-tfva with Matlab support, you can run a test case (tfva on E coli iAF1260) by calling

make test
